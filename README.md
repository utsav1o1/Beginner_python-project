Guess The Number:-
Write a programme where the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 20. 
The user needs to guess what the number is. 
If the user guesses wrong, tell them their guess is either too high, or too low.
This will get you started with the random library if you haven't already used it.

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:-
Make a rock-paper-scissors game where it is the player vs the computer. 
The computer’s answer will be randomly generated, while the program will ask the user for their input. 
This project will better your understanding of while loops and if statements.

Password Generator:-
Write a programme, which generates a random password for the user.
Ask the user how long they want their password to be, and how many letters and numbers they want in their password. 
Have a mix of upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols.
The password should be a minimum of 6 characters long.

Hangman:-
This is probably the hardest one out of these 6 small projects. This will be similar to guessing the number, except we are guessing the word. The user needs to guess letters,
Give the user no more than 6 attempts for guessing wrong letter. This will mean you will have to have a counter. You can download a ‘sowpods’ dictionary file or csv file to use as a way to get a random word to use.
